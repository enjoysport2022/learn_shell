#ls -l command can displays various information related to file permission

#the first column represents different access modes, i.e., the permission associated with a file or a directory

#The permissions are broken into groups of threes,
#and each position in the group denotes a specific permission,
#in this order: read (r), write (w), execute (x) âˆ’

#The first three characters (2-4) represent the permissions for the file's owner.
#The second group of three characters (5-7) consists of the permissions for the group to which the file belongs
#The last group of three characters (8-10) represents the permissions for everyone else

#Changing Permissions

#+: Adds the designated permission(s) to a file or directory.
#-: Removes the designated permission(s) from a file or directory.
#=: Sets the designated permission(s).
